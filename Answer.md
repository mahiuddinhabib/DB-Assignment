### Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

The tables **Product** and** Product_Category** are related to each other through a **one-to-many** relationship, where one product can belong to one category, but a category can have many products.

Here the column category_id is the foreign key of table Product which references the  id  column in the  Product_Category table.

### How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
 
###### Enforcing Integrity Constraints:

The most common approach is to enforce database constraints. We can set a **foreign key** constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. This constraint would reference the primary key of the "Product_Category" table.

When a new product is inserted, the database will check if the "category_id" exists in the "Product_Category" table. If it doesn't exist, the database will prevent the  insertion. This is how we can ensure that each product will have a valid category.
